Each `.cpp` file is a self-contained unit and can be compiled and run independently. To compile an individual file, use the following command:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 <filename>.cpp -o test
```
Learn ray tracing with 2 hours and play around with the `rayTracing.cpp` file to see the implementation.
A very good learning resource for understanding ray tracing, particularly how to implement it with parametric and implicit surfaces, is the following article:

[Scratchapixel - Parametric and Implicit Surfaces](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/minimal-ray-tracer-rendering-simple-shapes/parametric-and-implicit-surfaces.html)

`geometry.cpp` consists of a C++ program to check whether a point lies inside(including the boundary) of a triangle or outside. A good resource is the book [Mathematics for Computer Graphics](https://www.profajaypashankar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mathematics-for-Computer-Graphics-Fifth-Edition.pdf).
