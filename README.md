Each `.cpp` file is a self-contained unit and can be compiled and run independently. To compile an individual file, use the following command:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 <filename>.cpp -o test
```
Learn ray tracing with 2 hours and play around with the `rayTracing.cpp` file to see the implementation.
A very good learning resource for understanding ray tracing, particularly how to implement it with parametric and implicit surfaces, is the following article:
